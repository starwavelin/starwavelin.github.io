### Preface
Firstly I would like to sincerely thank Mr. Xuan Huang (黄玄 | [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro)) for providing this convenient Jekyll template.
He actually supplies two templates for the general public to use:
1. [boilerplate version](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxblog-boilerplate)
2. [his personal advanced version](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io)

What I am using for myself (Coding Bro 📒代码笔记哥）is the boilerplate version.

### Writing a journal
To write a journal for your blog, create a markdown file in ``_posts/`` directory with format "yyyy-mm-dd-{your-journal-title}.md", in which you can replace {your-journal-title} with any article name you want.  

Then, within the ``.md`` file, the header should be coded in a somehow fixed format. Here I'd like to show you two screenshots and I guess after viewing them, you will know how to code your article.

<small class="img-hint">in this 10-line header code of a markdown file, just make sure the layout should be "post", other fields can be customized or omitted</small>
![header-outcome](/img/in-post/180522-use-huxpro-template/header-outcome.png)
<small class="img-hint">corresponding outcome of the 10-line header code</small>

And, Huxpro template also provides an automatically generated summary of an article you post.

### Adding a table of contents
You can also add a table of content to your journal if you think necessary. To do so, you need a tool called [gfm-toc](https://github.com/starwavelin/AlgorithmPractice/blob/master/gfm-toc)  
And I already wrote an instruction on [how to use gfm-toc](https://github.com/starwavelin/AlgorithmPractice/blob/master/gfm-toc-usage.md)

Hmm, seems like directly apply the gfm-toc tool above did not give what I want.

No worries. I worked around to get it work. And, I will look into this in the future.

### Apply your own domain to your tech blog
