Mac's own terminal environment has some issues, such as cannot split into panes, does not distinguish file and directory names.

Setting up ```iTerm2``` and ```oh-my-zsh``` can give you a good way of using the terminal env.

### Install iTerm2
Assume you have homebrew installed for your mac, just do

```
$ brew cask install iterm2
```

Homebrew is a good package management tool for Mac, highly recommended to install.
You can find the installation command from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

### Install oh-my-zsh
You can find the curl command from [https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) to install oh-my-zsh

Like bash, Z shell (Zsh) is also a Unix shell.

Once you successfully installed oh-my-zsh, you are gonna see ```.zshrc``` being added to your ~ directory.

### Font and Layout setting for oh-my-zsh
Now comes into the cool part, setup fonts and layout for your Zsh. The way I did was:

**Install powerline fonts**  
git clone [https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) project  
then CD to the directory of powerline fonts, install it using  
```
$ sh ./install.sh
```  

**Change Preference for iTerm2**  
Colors: Solarized (light)  
Font Family: DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline  
Style: Book  
Size: 12pt  

**Change the ZSH THEME**  
In .zshrc, set
```
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

**$ zsh**  
To refresh the Z shell pane

*After the steps above, you can avoid ```$ pwd``` in the future*

### Update .zshrc file
Previously in order to invoke the environment variables already defined in .bash, I used a naive way by adding ```source ~/.bash_profile``` in .zshrc

Actually, I can just append environment variables into .zshrc directly cuz I am just launching iTerm2 with Zsh from now on.

For example, I can append node.js environment variables / commands to the end of .zshrc
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
