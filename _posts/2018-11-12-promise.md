In computer science, **future**, **promise**, **delay**, and **deferred** refer to constructs used for synchronizing program execution in some concurrent programming languages. They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is yet incomplete.
-- excerpt from Wikipedia

### When client side needs data that resolved from server side first

```
async clientFtn(): Promise<void> {
  await serverFtn();
  // Use data resolved from server side function
}
```

### Promise Loop
```
X = A & B & C   // A, B, C, who gets executed first does Not matter

promise.all([A,B,C]);
```

```
X = A -> B -> C   // A, B, C, who gets executed in order

[A,B,C].reduce((result, i) => result.then(i), Promise.resolve());
```

But, if doing so causes some trouble, ie. `The pool is probably full` issue, you can use a conservative `for of` loop way.

```
for (const el of this.array) {
  this.map[el] = await this.fetchMap(el);
}
```
Sometimes we don't use `array.map()` is because `array.map()` is asynchronous and we need **execution in sequence**, as we want in this `for ... of ...` loop.

#### When `for of` is not the solution
We can transcribe the code snippet above into
```
await Promise.all(this.array.map(async el => {
  this.map[el] = await this.fetchMap(el);
}));
```

### Promise.something vs. Bluebird.something
Promise.all is a better standard, it's default javascript, and if we use async await anyway, it will default wrap the result of this method's execution in a bluebird promise  
But since we have Bluebird.all available, we can use it directly without relying on the default wrapping.

Bluebird is a super set of native Promise so it is able to consume promise; that’s why wrapping to Bluebird can happen.
