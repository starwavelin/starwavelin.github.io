### 前言
亚马逊公司共有16条领导力法则(Leadership Principles)，具体的英文内容您可以在[这里](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)查到。  
本文提供行为面试时候常用到的11条法则的中英双语翻译。

### 1. Customer Obsession / 着迷于用户（以用户为中心思考）
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

领袖从用户出发以用户的角度来思考和工作。他们热心勤勉以赢得用户的信任。诚然，领导者需要关注他们的竞争对手，但更重要的是他们要想用户之所想。

### 2. Ownership / 所有权（主人翁精神）
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.".

领导者是项目或者说公司的主人。他们从长期价值的角度出发，不因短期利益而牺牲长期价值。他们不以自己所在的小组而是以公司主人翁的心态做决策和行动。他们从不说“这不关我的事”。

### 3. Invent and Simplify / 创新并化简
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

领导者从他们所在团队的运作中汲取创新的源泉，并简化新发明出来的流程、运作方法等等。他们为外部团队所知，并从其他地方获取新的思想。当我们做新事物、新方向的时候，我们愿意接受一个信息：也许我们曾在错误的方向上有一段时间了，是该有所改变了。

### 4. Are Right, A Lot / 常常做出对的决策
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

领导者虽然不总是对的，但他要能往往做出对的决策。他们有很强的判断力和非常好的直觉。他们寻求多角度的思考，并愿意从否定他们信念的角度进行思考和挑战。

### 5. Learn and Be Curious / 学习并保持好奇心
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

领导者从不觉得自己已经学得足够，与之相反，他们时常寻求如何自我提升。他们对新事物保持好奇心并付出行动主动探寻它们。

### 6. Insist on the Highest Standards / 坚持高的标准
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

领导者往往坚持常人觉得难以置信的高标准。他们不时地提升做事情的标准并带领团队为产出高水平的产品、服务和流程而努力。领导者确保错误不至于被发布到产品线上；他们尽可能地在第一时间修正错误。


### 7. Think Big / 宏观角度思考
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

微观思考就如同去实现一个自我实现的预言；领导者不这样做。领导者从宏观大局想问题和引导方向，并激发相应的结论。他们不同于常人地思考问题并从多角度去服务用户。


### 8. Bias for Action / 偏向于行动
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

在商务活动中，效率就是生命。很多决策和行动是可以回滚的所以我们不必拘泥于过多的事先调研。我们欢迎勇于承担一定预期风险的领导者。

### 9. Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

领导者听得仔细，说得真诚，并对他人报以尊重。他们会做自我批评，尽管有时这种自我批评会让他们显得难堪。领导者不相信他们团队成员的彩虹屁。他们是以最佳表现来衡量自身和自己的团队。

### 10. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

领导者从各个不同层面进行运作，虽然如上面一个要点所述，他们从宏观思考和管理，但他们仍保持与细节连接，并时常审核团队的运作情况。在实际情况和度量指标不相符的时候，他们保持怀疑。没有任何任务可以隐藏在他们的视线下。

### 11. Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

领导者吸收商务活动中的关键信息点并按时交付高质量的产品。尽管时有挫折，他们绝不言弃。



### 其余五条相对的没有在行为面试中考到那么多的亚马逊领导力法则，我也列举如下
但就不翻译了。   

1. Frugality   
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

2. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit   
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

3. Hire and Develop the Best   
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

4. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer   
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

5. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility    
We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
