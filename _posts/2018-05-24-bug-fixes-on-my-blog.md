**CDN**  
What libraries are using CDN for now?
1. **highlight.js v.8.6** (commented in the given template)
2. **fastclick v.1.0.6**  
https://cdn.bootcss.com/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js
3. **font-awesome v.4.2.0**  
https://cdn.staticfile.org/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
4. **html5shiv v.3.7.0** & **respond.js v.1.4.2**  
these two are for browsers lower than IE9, already in commented mode
5. **anchor-js v.1.1.1**  
https://cdn.bootcss.com/anchor-js/1.1.1/anchor.min.js  

The only one I found different from others is the one for font-awesome 4.2.0, which is supplied from ```https://cdn.staticfile.org/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css```. The original author left a comment saying *Hux change font-awesome CDN to qiniu*. So this CDN is actually from ‰∏ÉÁâõ‰∫ë for the convenience of viewers from mainland China.

Now let me just change this back to ```http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css``` and see if the page loading speed would improve.
